### Welcome to our Netflix UI project! üé¨üçø

## Introduction
This project aims to recreate the immersive experience of the Netflix user interface on the web. With a sleek design and user-friendly interface, our goal is to provide users with a seamless browsing experience akin to the popular streaming platform.

## Features
- Responsive Design: Our Netflix Front-End is designed to adapt to various screen sizes, ensuring a consistent experience across devices.

## Technologies Used
- <b>HTML:</b> HTML, short for Hypertext Markup Language, is the standard markup language used to create and design web pages. It provides the structure and content of a webpage by utilizing a system of tags and attributes. HTML documents are interpreted by web browsers to render text, images, multimedia, and other elements into a visually appealing and interactive format for users.
- <b>CSS:</b> CSS, short for Cascading Style Sheets, is a stylesheet language used to describe the presentation and layout of HTML documents. It enables web developers to control the appearance of web pages, including the colors, fonts, spacing, and positioning of elements, thereby enhancing the visual appeal and user experience.
