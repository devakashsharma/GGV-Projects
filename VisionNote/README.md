# VisionNote
VisionNote is a simple object detection module leveraging the power of YOLOv3 (You Only Look Once) â€” a state-of-the-art pre-trained dataset. Developed with the support of OpenCV (Open Source Computer Vision Library).

## Overview

- **Objective:** Efficient and accurate object detection in images and video frames.
- **Technology Stack:**
  - YOLOv3
  - OpenCV

## Getting Started

### Installation
1. Python
```
pip install python
```
2. opencv
```
pip install opencv-python
```
3. matplotlib
```
pip install matplotlib
```

And you can you can any versions of it. <br>
In this project we will be using YOLOv3-tiny for our project.

### You only look once (YOLO)
YOLOv3-tiny is often considered a good choice for beginners for the following reasons:

**Smaller Model Size:** YOLOv3-tiny has a smaller model size (5.56 billion FLOPs) compared to the larger YOLOv3 models, making it easier to work with on less powerful hardware.

**Faster Inference:** It has faster inference times due to its reduced size, which can be advantageous for real-time or embedded applications.

**Simplified Configuration:** YOLOv3-tiny uses a simplified configuration file (220 lines) compared to the larger YOLOv3 models, which makes it easier to understand and modify.

**Lighter Weight:** The model weights are smaller in size, making them easier to download and work with.

**Decent Performance:** While it may not achieve the same high accuracy as larger YOLOv3 models, it still provides reasonable object detection performance.
