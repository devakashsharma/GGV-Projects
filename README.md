# GGV-Projects

In this repository, I've gathered my collection of projects that are not just a project but a paradise for us. The creations of this repository are the result of pure dedication, boundless creativity, and the spirit of innovation. ❤️❤️

## What to install?
To achive our goal we need to install
1. Python
```
pip install python
```
2. opencv
```
pip install opencv-python
```
3. matplotlib
```
pip install matplotlib
```

## Next:

After the install of all required modules now we need to install YOLOv3 Weights, Configurations and classes names

Vist this offical website of YOLO - https://pjreddie.com/yolo/

And you can you can any versions of it.
I will choose YOLOv3-tiny for our project.

### You only look once (YOLO)
YOLOv3-tiny is often considered a good choice for beginners for the following reasons:

Smaller Model Size: YOLOv3-tiny has a smaller model size (5.56 billion FLOPs) compared to the larger YOLOv3 models, making it easier to work with on less powerful hardware.

Faster Inference: It has faster inference times due to its reduced size, which can be advantageous for real-time or embedded applications.

Simplified Configuration: YOLOv3-tiny uses a simplified configuration file (220 lines) compared to the larger YOLOv3 models, which makes it easier to understand and modify.

Lighter Weight: The model weights are smaller in size, making them easier to download and work with.

Decent Performance: While it may not achieve the same high accuracy as larger YOLOv3 models, it still provides reasonable object detection performance.
